## Assignment

The assignments this week include reading and running two notebooks and 
writing code in them as instructed. If you are on windows then you will
have to run notebook 7.3 before 7.2 to learn how to run notebooks on the 
cluster. Then you can complete notebook 7.2 on the cluster. 

Submitting the assignments will involve making pull-requests for both
notebooks. So you should first `fork` the 7-remote-pipelines repo, then 
clone your version of it on the cluster. Make changes to the files there
as instructed (including copying the finished files to the Assignment/ dir)
and then commit and push your changes. Finally, make a pull request in which
only those two files are modified. 

+ nb-7.2-subprocess.ipynb

Run all code in the notebook and write a Class object at the end and test it
as instructed in the notebook. Push changes and make pull request. 

+ nb-7.3-tunneling.ipynb

Run all of the code as instructed. Execute cells at the end of the notebook
on the remote cluster. Push changes and make pull request.
